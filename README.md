# Sorting Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C++. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate `.cpp` file, providing a clear and concise example of how it works.

## Implemented Algorithms

*   **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
*   **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
*   **Merge Sort**: An efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
*   **Quick Sort**: Another efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
*   **Selection Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the beginning.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of these sorting algorithms, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++).

### Example: Compiling and Running Bubble Sort

1.  **Compile the file:**
    ```bash
    g++ Bubble-Sort.cpp -o Bubble-Sort
    ```
2.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./Bubble-Sort
    ```
    (On Windows, you might just type `Bubble-Sort` or `Bubble-Sort.exe`)

Follow similar steps for other algorithms by replacing `Bubble-Sort.cpp` with the respective file name (e.g., `Insertion-Sort.cpp`, `Merge-Sort.cpp`).
